ChipWhispererÂ® Project
=====================

ChipWhisperer is an open source project dedicated to hardware security research. The main
GIT repository is held on the Assembla Page at http://www.chipwhisperer.com , which also
includes link to complete documentation etc.

As a convience, this GitHub repository is setup to periodically clone changes from the main
repository and push them here. Please DO NOT open issues on this repository as it is not
routinely monitored, instead use the Assembla Page. 

But if you prefer the use of GitHub for your own development, feel free to fork this project
from here! You'll be able to view changes in the original ChipWhisperer project.
